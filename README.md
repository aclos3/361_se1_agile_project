We are using Reactjs library to develop our web app.

#### Run App 
`npm start` is used during development to see your changes and such. It will auto-load your changes. 


#### Deploy App
`npm run build` 
will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder. This will be used at end when we're done, or if we want to test a version.
