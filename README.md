# features to be merged
develop features to be added to the 'develop' branch. This could also be branched or labeled as "pair1_features", "pair2_features" etc.

The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).
